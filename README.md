# Human-Face-Generator-using-StyleGAN
A StyleGAN based model to generate realistic synthetic face images. The images don't belong to any persons in the real world, verified through Google image search. These images can be used in Social media marketing, animation etc. Levi's partnered with Lalaland.AI to create such AI models for their social media content.
